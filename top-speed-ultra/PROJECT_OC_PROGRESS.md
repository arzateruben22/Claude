# Project OC: progress log

Newest first. Every claim names how it was checked. "Verified" means it was run in headless Chromium (SwiftShader,
software rendering) through Playwright, using the game's `window.__game` test hooks. No real phone or GPU was
available, so frame rates on real hardware are **not** measured.

## 2026-10-09: the real freeway network

### Data

- **OpenStreetMap is blocked here.** The sandbox blocks openstreetmap.org, overpass-api.de and geofabrik.de (proxy
  403).
- **Overture Maps is reachable.** Its public S3 bucket is open, and Overture's transportation theme is derived from
  OSM under the ODbL. We range-read only the parquet row groups that cover OC: 27 row groups in one file.
- **What came out.**
  - 4,166 motorway and trunk segments, with route refs, connectors, levels and destinations.
  - 46,902 street segments, used for overpasses.
- **Elevation.** 324 AWS Terrain Tiles at zoom 13 (USGS 3DEP/NED in the US).
- **The builder** is `tools/oc-network/build.py`, whose README explains it. It produces:
  - 20 carriageways and 1,247 ramp pieces
  - 1,256 junctions and 506 grade-separated crossings
  - 247 street overpasses and 428 exit signs with OSM destination text
- **Builder checks.**
  - 502 of 506 crossings clear 6.5 m. The other 4 are listed in its output.
  - The largest height step at a junction is 0.29 m.
- **Reachability** (offline graph check): every freeway direction can reach every other, except SR-261 South. That
  one really ends at Walnut Ave; in the game it turns you around.

### Engine

- **Rewrite onto the data.** The procedural single road was replaced:
  - `world/Path.ts`: spline paths, one-way, finite.
  - `world/Network.ts`: grid, surfaces, barriers, routing.
  - `world/Roads.ts`: chunk streaming for every path, overlap culling, decks and columns, guide signs, overpasses.
  - `world/Terrain.ts`: real elevation tiles, road embankments and cuts, OC scenery, the sea.
- **Physics** now collides with real barrier segments, gore noses included.
- **Traffic** runs on every nearby carriageway, follows Y junctions, and collides in world space.
- **Phone-first UI.** The Controls screen is gone. The top bar has View, Go to and Pause. The corner window shows a
  map or a sky camera. There are five traffic levels, a start-freeway picker, and a local leaderboard.

### Verified: driving through real interchanges (the autopilot steers, the physics drives)

Each chain is one continuous drive with no teleporting. Route and path switches came from the game's own
`trackPath`. One of the chains had started on I-405 North by mistake: the test script never passed its starting
point through to the browser. That bug was fixed for later runs, and the chain is still a valid drive.

| Chain | Freeways | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I-405 N → 55 N → 91 E → 241 S | 4 | All reached (I-5 S leg ran out of the 900 s test budget on the 241) |
| I-405 N → 55 N → I-5 N → 57 N | 4 | All reached: 405/55 connectors, 55→5 connector, the Orange Crush to the 57 |
| I-405 N → 55 S → 73 S → I-5 S | 4 | All reached: the 73 ends in the 5 at San Juan Capistrano |

Freeways driven so far: I-405, CA-55, CA-91, CA-241, I-5, CA-57 and CA-73.

Later the same day, after the steering change and the ramp-side fix:

| Chain | Result |
| --- | --- |
| I-405 N → 55 N → 91 E → 241 S | All reached again with the new steering |
| 91 W → 55 S → I-5 S | Reached. The 55 South starts from the 91 at a Y |
| I-5 S → 55 S → 405 N, then 55 N → 91 W → 57 S → **22 E** | All reached |
| 241 N → **133 S** → I-5 N → 55 N → 91 E → 241 S, then **133 N** | Both 133 directions reached. The 261 leg ran out of its 1,600 s budget; reaching 241 South from 241 North means a long loop |
| 241 S → **261 S** at the Y (`dbg3.js`) | Hand-off at s = 9,197 m, then 500 m on the 261 |

**All ten freeways have now been driven through real junctions:** I-5, I-405, 22, 55, 57, 73, 91, 133, 241, 261.

**Bug found and fixed.** The autopilot drove past the I-5 South → 133 connector. `sideOf()` judged the ramp's
side against the straight tangent at the split, and the 5 curves there. It now projects onto the curved road.

- **No page errors.** None of the game runs logged a page error. The only error in the logs came from that same test
  script.

### Verified: Speed Survival (`modes.js`)

- 45 s at the autopilot's 116 mph cruise in Heavy traffic: score 1,601, best streak 10.6 s, 8 clean passes,
  1 near miss.
- A car that has already scored can't score again.
- The streak drops to 0 under 100 mph, and the best streak is kept.
- Ramming a car at a closing speed of about 22 m/s ends the run, and the results screen shows.
- The results screen shows the "Local leaderboard · this device only" label. The automated check for this missed it
  first time: the CSS uppercases the label, and the check was case-sensitive. The label itself is there.

### Verified: physics fixes

- **Bug: traffic collisions pumped energy in.** The car you hit was slowed instead of pushed, so contact repeated
  every step. Seen: 275 mph backwards. Fixed the sign of the impulse.
- **Sim mode spinning at about 160 mph.** Three causes:
  - The tyre falloff had a step at 0.12 rad. It's now smooth.
  - The 2.6° steering floor at speed asked for about 13 g. Lock is now speed-sensitive, at about 0.6° at 200 mph.
  - Sim had no stability control at all. It now has a light race-mode one that only acts past about 5° of slide.

  Result, autopilot at handling 1 (`sim.js`):

  | Cruise | Worst slide | Spins |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 134 mph | 0.8° | none |
  | 168 mph | 3.6° | none |
  | Flat out (166 mph on the curves) | 14.5°, once | none |

  There was one 14.5° slide flat out. Race-mode stability control caught it.

### Verified: UI at phone size (390 × 844, touch)

- The menu, start picker, Go-to picker, driving HUD and sky camera all render. There's no horizontal scroll.
- Found and fixed: the top bar covered the gear readout, and the grey HUD labels were unreadable against a bright sky.

### Verified: hands

- The thumb used to cross the rim face like a stick. It now lies along the rim's inner side, and the back of the
  hand sits over the rim.

### Not done yet, honestly

- **Performance on a real phone is unmeasured.** In SwiftShader the Low preset drew about 400 to 800 calls and
  500k triangles. Tree canopies were the biggest share and now have a 4× lighter phone version, not yet re-measured.
- **The P2–P4 systems aren't built.** That's the versioned profile, weather and day/night, drivers and abilities,
  races, economy and garage, the Ultra Realism unlock, and radio. See the roadmap.
- **Exits.** There are no exit numbers, and street ramps rejoin by moving you to an on-ramp, not by driving streets.

## Before this log

- **Top Speed OC v1/v2.** A single-file canvas game, committed and published earlier (commit 24ac829).
- **Ultra.** A 3D engine on a procedural freeway. It became the base for this work.
